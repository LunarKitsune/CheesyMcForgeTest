Line 22: Need to figure out how blocks are registered properly to retrieve
ID.

It is noted:
    1: KaupenJoe uses forge version 52 so they will definitely have changes
       to how the coding is done a bit in minecraft

    2: It was noted that others did in fact have trouble getting their custom
       block to actually have an ID when running their client.

Will want to figure out data generators so I don't have to worry about this.

Will put a notes layout for anyone who wants to use it for the specs I am using to
make modding much easier.

Data Generator resources will be under:
