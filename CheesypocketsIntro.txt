Hi I am cheesypockets.

I am doing this project here to learn about minecraft modding and doing this as a project
to have something to stimulate myself with while having an interesting time with more
code learning.

Ive played minecraft on and off and vanilla minecraft definitely gets stale after a while.
After playing around a while on that I eventually started doing Medieval Minecraft that
I downloaded from CursedForge and it changed how I look at minecraft.

Now after a very long time later I am trying my hand at mmodding myself. I am very new to
it so I am figuring out the mechanics and code that come from the forge MDKs as well as
the original minecraft files. This will be more a journey and I hope to come out figuring
what I want to mod while having picked up new things.
