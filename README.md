# Welcome to my Minecraft 1.21.5 modding learning project!

To introduce myself: I am cheesypockets (username Lunar_Kitsune here on github)

In the real world I work a 9 to 5 job at a hotel. Here I decided to do learn minecraft modding after playing medieval minecraft long ago
made by Lunar Pixels and found vanilla minecraft to generally be more boring after. 

I am following the KaupenJoe tutorials on youtube here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1GspJBXQEGuhazihZCSSLmK">KaupenJoe 1.21 Forge Tutorials</a>

#### 1. Do I have any plans on what I want to create?:
   Not quite at the moment! I am just learning the minecraft modding system with Forge 55.02 being with the ins and outs to create things.

   However doesn't mean I don't have ideas. For example I feel minecraft might be a little imbalanced in terms of how its own mechanics works. 

   for example: Players heal quite quickly, but yet even making your own healing potions through alchemy takes a long time getting to the
   nether and getting blaze rods.

   I think I will play minecraft on and off to see what I want and look at other mods to gain ideas.

### 2. How long will this take?:
   Likely quite a while! I am essentially jumping into a version of minecraft that not all the changes are clearly well documented yet, but 
   have in fact changed such as item consolidation and features related to modeling and textures for example.

   This is going to be a LOONG Journey.
